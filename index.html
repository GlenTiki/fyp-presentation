        <h1>What is it?</h1>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Well, my abstract says...</h2>
        <p>MediaSync is a full solution to synchronised consumption of media (video & audio) online with other people. It is a responsive online application which will allow multiple users (clients) in a virtual room the ability to control the playback of media for other users in that room. The result being that they will all see the same thing at the same time (with a delay of up to 4 seconds).</p>
        <p>While the synchronization technology is the main feature of the application, an interactive social media application has been developed to utilise this technology. This application will have an advanced permission system built around the control of playback and user entry into rooms. This application is designed to be a social media service to enable the sharing of what they are currently watching with their friends or family.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What this means is that...</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a responsive website</li>
          <li>It allows you to consume media in sync with other connected users</li>
          <li>It allows users to dynamically control playback of media and everyone else connected stays in sync</li>
          <li>It's an online social service you can sign up for</li>
          <li>When you sign up, you get extra features 
            <ul>
              <li>Like controlling permissions in a media room you create</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Also, there are built in tools for finding popular rooms and rooms close to you</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Why are things done like they are?!</h1>
      </Section>
      <section>
        <h2>So wait... What's a media room?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are many providers of media online, who all provide similar interfaces</li>
          <li>The basic premise is that users can create their own areas on my service </li>
          <li>Within these areas, they can consume/queue media from online providers with their friends</li>
          <li>This area is a Room</li>
          <li>Rooms have unique urls for sharing and identifying them</li>
          <li>Within these Rooms, people play media</li>
          <li>Anyone who joins these Room will then see the media which is currently playing.</li>
          <li>Most importantly: in synch</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>The permissions system</h1>
        <p>In my report, I outline a permissions system for rooms</p>
        <p>The permissions system allows users to configure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Room Type</li>
          <li>Playback control/restriction</li>
          <li>User classes within the room</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Room types</h1>
        <p>Rooms can be one of three types</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Public - Anyone can enter it</li>
          <li>Members Only - Only signed up users can enter it</li>
          <li>Invite Only - Only invited users or staff may enter it</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Playback controlled</h1>
        <p>If playback is controlled/restricted within a room, the currently playing media can only be modified by certain users.</p>
        <p>This allows owners to only let people they know to change the playback... etc.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>In a room, there are several user classes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Owners - can change anything in a room</li>
          <li>Managers - can promote users to bouncers or djs</li>
          <li>bouncers - can promote users to vip</li>
          <li>Djs - can control playback when playback is restricted</li>
          <li>VIPs - Can enter an invite only room</li>
          <li>Standard - This is anyone who is not a VIP or staff</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What technology is used, and why is it used?</h1>
        <h2>Monolithic!</h2>
        <h2>Built with node.js!</h2>
        <h2>React.js!</h2>
        <h2>Websockets!</h2>
        <h2>NoSQL Database!</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Why Monolithic?</h1>
        <h2><i>Because it works</i></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Because I know it</li>
          <li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">Because Martin Fowler says so</a></li>
          <li>The alternative is only recommended to use when your project gets big</li>
          <li><i>Really big</i></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>What is the alternative? how does it differ?</h1>
        <p>The alternative is Microservices, a practice whereby you break down all functionality into seperate running processes/services</p>
        <p>Monoliths just keep this functionality in a single process</p>
        <p>Microservices add a lot of complexity with sending messages to and from services</p>
        <p>Monoliths... don't</p>

        <h1>Why Node.js?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I compared Node, Python, Ruby, C++, Java and GoLang in depth, this is just an overview</li>
          <li>I know Node, and using it would allow me to use a single language for everything</li>
          <li>Python, Ruby and C++ are all good languages, but I don't know them like I know node</li>
          <li>I know Java, but, I dislike the amount of code required compared to node</li>
          <li>Go is getting popular and looks good. But I don't know it</li>
          <li>I would have liked to use Go because it looks so promising, but because I don't have enough time to learn a new language and because I know node and it allows me to use javascript for everything, it was my chosen technology.</li>

      <section>
        <h1>Why React.js?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I compared React, Angular, Backbone and Ember</li>
          <li>Angular is popular, but there are two very different versions, 1 and 2</li>
          <li>Backbone and Ember are not as popular, but are similar to angular</li>
          <li>They promote the MVC approach</li>
          <li>React is getting very popular right now</li>
          <li>It promotes a different approach, using something developed for react, called flux.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What is MVC?</h2>
        <p>MVC works on the principle that that all application data which needs to be used is stored or accessed from the Model component. However, both Views and Controllers can interact with the Model component and modify that data, so it can lead to the View and Controller having different local data within them, causing display/functionality errors when they interact.</p><img src="images/about-mvc.jpg" style="width:30%;height:30%">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What is flux?</h2>
        <p>unidirectional flow, multiple components: a dispatcher, data-stores, views and actions</p>
        <p>A single “dispatcher” has a registry of all the data-stores. these get updates when certain events or actions occur to update their data. These data-stores have views which render the data they contain. These views can send events to the singular dispatcher. This will keep all data consistent, so there should be no display errors like with MVC.</p><img src="images/about-flux.jpg" style="width:30%;height:30%">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Coming into this, I was new to both mvc and flux approaches. </p>
        <p>I have decided that because of my lack of familiarity with any of the available tools, to choose the one that seems like the best fit, while also beig quite popular.</p>
        <p>It seems like flux is very well suited for an event based system, which the media synchronisation functionality is.</p>
        <p>And react is popular right now, so I wanted to see why.</p>

        <h1>Further reinforcement in these choices:</h1>
        <h4>in the recent TSSG summit, Mícheál ó Foghlú and Rory Walsh verified all of my choices of using node, react and microservices</h4>

      <section>
        <h1>Why WebSockets?</h1>
        <h4>I compared WebSockets and WebRTC, and I originally wanted to use WebRTC, But...</h4>
        <ul>
          <li class="nd">Using WebSockets, all realtime messages must go through my server... not ideal.</li>
          <li class="nd">Using WebRTC, Clients connect directly together in a peer-to-peer fashion. Good</li>
          <li class="nd">I was already familiar with WebSockets, but I needed to investigate WebRTC to see if it would work</li>
          <li class="nd">I interviewed a google developer expert on WebRTC(<a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/people/dan-jenkins">Dan Jenkins</a>)</li>
          <li class="nd">and he said to only expect 7-20 users connected together with WebRTC.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>So I decided to stick with WebSockets over WebRTC</h1>
        <p>because there is potentially no limit to the amount of people who can connect</p>

        <h1>Why a NoSQL server?</h1>

      <section>
        <h1>Keeping things in synchronisation</h1>
        <ul>
          <li class="nd">This is done by sending sync messages to users in a room</li>
          <li class="nd">When a user enter a room, they get the current plackback time from the server</li>
          <li class="nd">Whenever a user modifies the current playback time, all other users in the room get a message with this new time</li>
          <li class="nd">Whenever the queue is modified, the information is sent to connected users</li>
          <li class="nd">Because all of these messages go through my server, the server can store relevant data in the database, eg, when the queue is modified</li>
